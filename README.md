# Testing-Cloud-Application

<h2>Description</h2>
Scenario: Version is developing a new VPN service called Sasha. Sasha will support both Verizon internal employees and external customers for their
secured connection to the Verizon Cloud Platform. It allows for traffic monitoring, analytics, and vulnerability mitigation by filtering incoming traffic and requires proper
authorization.
<br/><br/>
Newly assigned to this project, I am tasked with verifying the whether Version's new cloud application (Sasha) is implementing cloud native traits: redundancy, resiliency, and least priviledge.
<br><br>

<h2>Redundancy Test:</h2>
<h2>Resiliency Test:</h2>
<h2>Least Priviledge Test:</h2>
